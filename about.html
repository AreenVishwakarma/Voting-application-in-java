        <h2>About the Online Voting System</h2>
        <p>An online voting system that will replace the old ballot system or paper system. Over time, technology has improved efficiency and saved resources in many sectors, yet the voting system remains expensive and requires a significant workforce.</p>
        <p>We bring a system that is safe, reliable, and solves modern issues like higher reachability of the booth, crowd-free voting, lower costs, and faster results.</p>
